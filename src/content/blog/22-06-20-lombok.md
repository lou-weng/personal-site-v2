# Introduction to Lombok

## What is Lombok?
## What is an annotation?

## @Builder
Using the @Builder annotation: you want to create multiple instances of an object with different configurations. If the object has a complex constructor, you may be forced to create multiple chains of different constructors. The builder pattern provides you the flexibility to create objects through method chaining rather than multiple constructors:

```
// Without builder pattern

public class Pizza {

    // ... pretend fields exist here

    // you need multiple constructors to instantiate the right type of pizza you want
    public Pizza (String topping, String sauce, String crust, String vegetarian) {}
    public Pizza (String sauce, String crust) {}
    public Pizza (String topping) {}
}

//  With builder pattern (assuming you have lombok)

@Builder
public class Pizza {

    // ... pretend fields exist here

}

// Creating a pizza with the Builder pattern

Pizza p = Pizza.builder()
    .topping("olives")
    .sauce("tomato")
    .crust("thin")
    .vegetarian(false)
    .build();

```

@Data
Using the @Data annotation: quick and easy way to create the following code snippets:
- @Getter
- @Setter
- @ToString
- @EqualsAndHashCode
- @RequiredArgsConstructor
